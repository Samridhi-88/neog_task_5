            <h3> Uttar Pradesh Famous Places-Uttar Pradesh is the Heartland of India. In uttar pradesh so many famous places are there but only 14 places most famous in that so i want to tell about these places.

                1.Agra-It might sound odd that Agra overtakes Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh. It is no wonder, considering the fact that Agra is home to the world famous Taj Mahal. This ancient city has wonderful monuments making you awestruck by the sheer brilliance behind the construction. 
                2.Varanasi-‘The Religious Capital of India’ as Varanasi is called, is frequented by pilgrims from various parts of the world. Considered one amongst the seven holy spots for those who follow Hinduism, the land attracts those who belong to other faiths too. It lies on the banks of the river Ganges, which adds magic to the atmosphere. Given below are the top tourist spots in Varanasi.

              <h3> A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing. Every value in Python has a datatype. Different data types in Python are Numbers, List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary, etc.Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic
                   or logical computation. The value that the operator operates on is called the operand. For example: >>> 2+3 5. Here, + is the operator that performs addition.
                   2 and 3 are the operands and 5 is the output of the operation.In the context of most data science work, Python for loops are used to loop through an iterable object (like a list, tuple, set, etc.) and perform the same action for each entry. For example, a for loop would allow us to iterate through a list, performing the same action on each item in the list.</h3>
